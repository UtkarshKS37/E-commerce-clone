                <p class="text-small">The drought of ICC tournament victories is over for India. India 
                valiantly fought and clenched onto their dreams of winning the world cup and 
                accomplished the task after a long 13 years as they go undefeated throughout the torunament. 
                India win the World Cup in the T20 format after 17 years in a nail-biting, close match-up 
                thriller by defying all odds and predictions, and defeating the alleged "Choker Champions" 
                South Africa.</p>

                crucial runs at the top of the order, ensuring solid starts in multiple games. His 
                leadership was instrumental in navigating the team through challenging phases and finally
                fulfilled his destiny by winning the T20 World Cup, and then retired from the format.</p>

            <p class="text-vk">Virat Kohli was the backbone of India's batting, scoring a critical 76 in the 
            final. Although his batting looked lacklustre during the tournament, but in the final 
            his ability to anchor the innings were key to India's success, saving the Indian batting 
            from yet another collapse when it mattered the most. He announced his retirement from T20Is 
            after winning the T20 World Cup, having completed white ball cricket, leaving on 
            a high note.​</p>

            <p class="text-jb">Jasprit Bumrah lead the bowling attack with 15 wickets, choking the run rate 
                and providing a breakthrough whenever required, at an exceptional economy below 5 in the T20 
                World Cup. His spell in the final was decisive, earning him the Player of the Tournament award. 
                He, with his ability to bowl multiple variations along with his unique action, is truly the best 
                bowler of this generation regardless of the format.</p>

            his notable 42 and crucial catches against Pakistan setting the tone in the group stage.

            <p class="text-sky">Suryakumar Yadav was India's second-highest run-scorer, adapting his play 
            according to the situation. His 47 in the semi-final against England, sharp fielding and 
            undoubtedly the best catch of this career in the final were the highlights of his campaign.</p>

                the final, helping India reach a competitive total. His role as a finisher was crucial in 
                tight matches​. As an all-rounder, he was also an extra bowling option for the captain.</p>

            <p class="text-ap">Axar excelled both with bat and ball and in the field, playing a pivotal 
                role as a floater in the batting order and delivering key spells with his left-arm spin. 
                His marvellous 47 in the final and tight-ended bowling spells, like against England were 
                crucial for India's defense​ He stood out in the team and justified the title of "Bapu" 
                given to him.</p>

                match-winning 50 against Bangladesh and crucial overs in the final. His ability to score 
                quickly and bowl under pressure effectively made him a standout player and rightfully earn 
                the #1 rank in the ICC T20I all-rounders rankings. He went from being booed and trolled 
                during the IPL to becoming a national hero.</p>

                crucial 17 in the semi-final. His fielding remained top-notch, although his bowling was 
                not as effective as expected. Nevertheless, he ended his T20I career as champion.</p>

                <p class="text-ms">Although Siraj's tournament was cut short after the group stage, his initial 
                    spells helped set the tone for the bowling unit. His ability to swing the ball and bowl 
                    economically was a valuable asset, and could have been beneficiary in the finals where 
                    spin bowling was being wrecked​.</p>
